## Overview

In this project, we utilize SQL to perform various exploratory data analysis tasks. The analysis includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using SQL queries.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is [describe your dataset here, e.g., "a music store database containing tables related to customers, sales, and inventory."] 

## Installation

To run the SQL scripts, you will need a SQL database management system (DBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. Ensure you have one installed on your local machine.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-SQL.git
